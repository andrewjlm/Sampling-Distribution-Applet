Sampling-Distribution-Applet
============================

Allows the user to simulate sampling for different statistics from two of the variables in the `diamonds` dataset. It displays the true population histogram and the sampling distribution histogram next to each other so the user can see how different sample sizes and number of samples impact the statistics.

This app started as an small project I did one afternoon in response to a class prompt. I used it as an opportunity to play around with Shiny.

You can see the app in action at:
